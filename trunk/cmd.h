// cmd.h -- Command buffer and command execution

//===========================================================================

/*

Any number of commands can be added in a frame, from several different sources.
Most commands come from either keybindings or console line input, but remote
servers can also send across commands and entire text files can be execed.

The + command line options are also added to the command buffer.

The game starts with a Cbuf_AddText ("exec quake.rc\n"); Cbuf_Execute ();

*/


void Cbuf_Init (void);
// allocates an initial text buffer that will grow as needed

void Cbuf_AddText (char *text);
// as new commands are generated from the console or keybindings,
// the text is added to the end of the command buffer.

void Cbuf_InsertText (char *text);
// when a command wants to issue other commands immediately, the text is
// inserted at the beginning of the buffer, before any remaining unexecuted
// commands.

void Cbuf_Execute (void);
// Pulls off \n terminated lines of text from the command buffer and sends
// them through Cmd_ExecuteString.  Stops when the buffer is empty.
// Normally called once per frame, but may be explicitly invoked.
// Do not call inside a command function!

//===========================================================================

/*

Command execution takes a null terminated string, breaks it into tokens,
then searches for a command or variable that matches the first token.

Commands can come from three sources, but the handler functions may choose
to dissallow the action or forward it to a remote server if the source is
not apropriate.
