##### `cl_maxfps`

Customizes the maximal fps, `72` by default.  
If `cl_independentphysics` is switched **OFF** (default is **ON**), the value of this cvar is reverted back to `72` if you start recording a demo.

before the UI hiding animation starts.

##### `cl_demouihidespeed`

Speed of the demo UI hiding animation which begins once the above timeout has
elapsed.

##### `cl_independentphysics`

Server and Client framerates are independent. This setting is turned on by default. To turn it off you need to start joequake with the following command line:

```
+set cl_independentphysics 0
```

##### `freefly_speed`
##### `orbit_speed`

Set the speed the camera moves when in freefly or orbit mode (respectively).
`800` / `200` by default.

##### `freefly_show_pos`
##### `freefly_show_pos_x`
##### `freefly_show_pos_y`
##### `freefly_show_pos_dp`

Show the freefly camera's current origin.
Position can be changed with the `_x` and `_y` coordinates.
The number of decimal places can be changed with the `_dp` variable.

##### `cl_bbox`

Enables bounding boxes for non-map entities. The bounding boxes are derived from
information available to the client, therefore they work while playing a demo as
well as when playing a live game. However, the bounding boxes have the following
limitations:

- If using non-id1 progs, bounding boxes may be missing or incorrect.  This is
  unavoidable since bounding box information is not sent to the client or stored
  in the demo, and are defined in each mod's QuakeC.  It is therefore
  impossible, in general, for the client to know the bounding boxes.
- Bounding box origins may be wrong by up to 0.125 game units owing to fixed
  precision in the coordinates sent to the client and stored in the demo.
- Bounding boxes are not displayed when *recording* a demo.

The cvar takes the following values:
- `0`: Bounding boxes are never drawn.
- `1`: Bounding boxes are drawn during demo playback and when playing live, but
  not when recording.
- `2`: Bounding boxes are drawn only during demo playback.
- `3`: Bounding boxes are drawn only when playing live, but not when recording.

##### `cl_bboxcolors`

When set to `1` (the default), `cl_bbox` bounding boxes are colored according to
entity type:
- Monsters are red.
- Pickups are green.
- Everything else is white.

When set to `0` bounding boxes are all drawn white.

#### Server

##### `sv_altnoclip`

Switches on alternative noclip movement where the player always moves towards
the direction he's looking at.
`1` by default.

##### `sv_override_spawnparams`

Allows to enable or disable overriding the spawn parameters on every spawn of a player.
The overriding values can be set using the command `setspawnparam <paramnum> <value> [0]`.
This allows to set starting stats for when starting levels with the `map` or `record` commands, e.g. for singleplayer segmented runs.

##### `sv_noclipspeed`

Dedicated max speed value used only while noclip.
Its value is `320` by default.

##### `sv_novis`

When set to 1, entities are not PVS culled before being sent to the client.  In
practice this means that all enemies are visible when `r_outline_monsters` is
used, and that all monsters are recorded in demos.  The latter is useful for
being able to see entities that the player can't see in recams or when using the
freefly feature.

This naturally inflates demo size, so be careful using it with entity heavy
maps.

#### Network

##### `net_connectsearch`

Allows to enable or disable the search for hosts on use of the `connect`
command. It allows connecting by the server's hostname instead of by IP address.
However, the search takes a significant amount of time. So disabling it can
greatly speedup the time it takes to connect to a server by IP address.
`1` by default. Set to `0` to try to speedup connecting by IP address.

##### `net_getdomainname`

Allows to enable or disable trying to find domain names for IP addresses using
DNS lookups. These can find domain names like `nl2.badplace.eu` from its IP
address. However, on Windows this lookup seems to take a long time. Disabling it
can therefore speed up connecting to a server significantly. As there will
barely be any usecase for the domain names, it is `0` by default. Set to `1` to
restore the original Quake behaviour with the lookups enabled.

#### Video

##### `vid_hwgammacontrol`

Turns gamma changing possibility on/off, `1` by default.
With using a value of `2`, it applies gamma for windowed modes as well.

`2` - Animations are lerped including weapon muzzleflash animations  
Default value is `1`.

##### `gl_interpolate_movement`

Switches on lerped model movement, default value is `1` (on).

##### `gl_interpolate_distance`

Sets the maximum distance between vertexes where animation lerping takes place.
This variable was implemented exclusively for gl_interpolate_animation, when used with the value `2`.  
It is rather a technical thing, it serves fine-tuning of muzzleflash animations.
If you're not entirely familiar of this feature I recommend not adjusting it.
Its default value is `135`. It cannot be set higher than `300`.

##### `gl_externaltextures_world`

##### `capture_mp3_kbps`

Sets mp3 compression's bitrate, `128` by default.
Only works if `capture_mp3` is `1` (trivial).

##### `capture_avi_split`

Set this to the number of megabytes at which to split captured video into more
than one AVI file. The used video capture module has a problem with files
getting corrupted when reaching a size of over 2 gigabytes, so splitting them
into smaller files is a good idea to avoid this corruption.  
Default is `1900` megabytes.  
Setting to `0` disables splitting.

#### Path Tracer

##### `pathtracer_record_player`

If set to `1`: Record path that you, the player, takes. Includes movement keys.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_show_player`

If set to `1`: Draws path that was previously recorded, draws movement keys.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_show_demo`

If set to `1`: Draws path of the demo. If the demo contains movement keys then they will be drawn.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_show_ghost`

If set to `1`: Draws path of the ghost. If the ghost contains movement keys then they will be drawn.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_movekeys_player`

If set to `1`: Draw the movement keys on the path.

Default: `1`

##### `pathtracer_movekeys_demo`

If set to `1`: Draw the movement keys on the path

Default: `1`

##### `pathtracer_movekeys_ghost`

If set to `1`: Draw the movement keys on the path

Default: `1`

##### `pathtracer_fadeout_ghost`

If set to `1`: Draw path (and if available movment keys) only directly around the current position of the ghost. Other parts of the path are greyed out.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_fadeout_demo`

If set to `1`: Draw path (and if available movment keys) only directly around the current position of the demo. Other parts of the path are greyed out.

Default: `1`

##### `pathtracer_fadeout_seconds`

Number of seconds to show path and movement key (if available) information around the current ghost or demo position.

Default: `3`

##### `pathtracer_line_smooth`

If set to `1`: Enables line smoothing which makes the lines bolder and better visible.

Default: `0`

##### `pathtracer_line_skip_threshold`

The line will not be drawn if the length between the frames is larger than this threshold. This help to not draw lines through the whole map when teleporting. This is a very technical topic, should not be relevant for most people.

Default: `160`


### Commands

#### All

##### `cmdlist`

Lists all console commands.

##### `cvarlist`

Lists all console variables.

##### `find`  
##### `apropos`

Finds all relevant console commands and variables.

##### `gamedir <path>`

Changes the mod's directory.  
If you started Quake with e.g. `-game ctf` and during the game
you wish to play with an other mod, you can change it dinamically,
without quitting the game.  
Relative pathnames like `newdir/ctf` are not allowed.

##### `dir <wildcard>`

Lists all files matching wildcard. Works the same way like other shells' dir command.

##### `demdir <wildcard>`

The same as dir, except that this cmd is only for .dem files.
So please omit the .dem extension from the wildcard.

##### `menu_maps`  
##### `menu_demos`  
##### `menu_mods`

These commands display the appropriate new main menus, 
as if you were opened them from the *Main* menu.

##### `menu_mouse`  
##### `menu_hud`  
##### `menu_sound`  
##### `menu_view`  
##### `menu_renderer`  
##### `menu_textures`  
##### `menu_particles`  
##### `menu_decals`  
##### `menu_weapons`  
##### `menu_screenflahes`  
##### `menu_miscellaneous`

These commands display the appropriate options submenus,
as if you were opened them from the *Options* menu.

##### `menu_crosshair_colorchooser`  
##### `menu_sky_colorchooser`

These commands display the color chooser submenus,
as if you were opened them from:
- the *Options / Hud options / Crosshair color* menu
- the *Options / View options / Solid sky color* menu

##### `menu_namemaker`

This command displays the name maker submenu,
as if you were opened it from the *Multiplayer / Setup / Name maker* menu.

##### `writeconfig <filename>`

Writes a .cfg file with your actual game settings.

##### `printtxt <filename>`

Prints a text file into the console. You can now read SDA demos' txt files without quitting the game :)

##### `getcoords <filename>`

Writes the player's origin into the given file or to `camfile.cam` if there
was no filename given.

##### `volumeup`  
##### `volumedown`

`volumeup` increases the volume by `0.1`.  
`volumedown` decreases by the same value.  
The maximum volume is `1.0`, it won't raise higher than that. You'll see a graphical volume control bar at the top right corner of the screen for 2 seconds any time you change the volume using volumeup or volumedown.

##### `iplog`  
##### `ipmerge`  
##### `identify`

These commands are exported from ProQuake. Please read the ProQuake documentation on using them.

##### `loadsky <filename>`

Loads a custom skybox.  
As you know (or not) a skybox consists of 6 images (6 sides of a box).
To set a skybox, you only have to add the common name of these six files,
since they contain 2 characters of skybox extension at the end.  
For example, you have a skybox called `day`, you have six images called
`dayrt`, `daybk`, `daylf`, `dayft`, `dayup`, `daydn`. Then you only have to use `loadsky day`.  
Skyboxes goes to `/env` directory.
This command also sets `r_skybox`'s value. You can change skyboxes using
this cvar as well.

##### `loadcharset <filename>`

Loads an external console charset. Console charsets should be placed inside textures/charsets dir.

##### `capture_start <filename>`

Starts capturing an .avi file.

##### `capture_stop`

Stops capturing.

##### `capturedemo <filename>`

Starts playing a demo and starts capturing it also with the same name.

##### `keepdemo`

When automatic demo recording is switched on (`cl_autodemo` is `1`), using this command renames the temporary demo file to its final name, based on the `cl_autodemo_format` cvar.  
This command is only valid on the intermission/finale screen!  
See more details about `cl_autodemo` in the Cvars section.

##### `demoskip`

When playing back a marathon demo, skips the amount of levels by the set value. Negative numbers are also valid.  
For example: when playing back an episode 1 marathon (e1m1 - e1m7):
- using `skipdemo +2` on e1m2 will jump to e1m4
- using `skipdemo -3` on e1m6 will jump to e1m3

##### `demoseek`

Seeks the amount of seconds by the set value during demo playback.
Available usage modes (example values):
- `demoseek 12` will seek to the time 0:12
- `demoseek +3` will seek forward 3 seconds from the actual position
- `demoseek -5` will seek back 5 seconds from the actual position
- `demoseek +f` will seek forward one frame.
- `demoseek -f` will seek back one frame.

##### `toggleparticles`

Changes all `gl_part_*` cvar values between `0` (off), `1` (QMB) or `2`(Quake3).  
A pleasant way if you want to toggle between particle themes and wouldn't like to set each variable one by one.

##### `toggledecals`

Changes all `gl_decal_*` cvar values between `[0|1]`.

##### `fog`

Applies fog to the map. Used implicitly by newer maps.  
Usage:  
`fog <density>`  
`fog <red> <green> <blue>`  
`fog <density> <red> <green> <blue>`  
`<density>` defines the thickness of the fog.  
`<red> <green> <blue>` values define the color of the fog.

##### `fog_set`

Saves the actual fog values (set at map start) to the `fog_custom` variable.

##### `printspawnparams [clientnum]`

Prints the spawn parameters of clients on the server. If `clientnum` is given,
prints the spawn parameters for the client with that number. If it is not given, prints the spawn parameters for all active clients on the server.

##### `setspawnparam <paramnum> <value> [clientnum]`

Sets the spawn parameter with index `paramnum` to `value`. If `clientnum` is
given, the spawn parameter of the client with that number is changed. If it is
not given, the spawn parameter of the host is changed.

##### `writenextspawnparams [clientnum] [filename]`

Writes a config to store the spawn parameters as they would be if the current
map is finished as is. Can be executed to start playing the next map with those
stored spawn parameters.

If this client is not the server host, the spawn parameters of this client are
written and assigned to the number `clientnum` (`0` if not given). If this
client is the server host, writes spawn parameters of the client with number
`clientnum`. If `clientnum` is not given, writes the spawn parameters for all
active clients on the server.

The name of the written config file can be given as `filename`. If not present,
an automatic name based on current map and time is used.

##### `sv_protocol`

Overrides the default `15` (NetQuake) protocol version with given value. Recognized values are `666` (FitzQuake) and `999` (RMQ).
This command primarly aims to keep JoeQuake compatible with mods.

##### `freefly`
##### `orbit`

Toggle freefly / orbit mode.  Freefly is a free flying third-person camera that
can be used during demo playback.  When enabled, the usual inputs will
manipulate the camera's position and angle (`+moveleft`, `+moveright`,
`+forward`, `+back`, mouse movements, etc).

Orbit is a camera that is locked to have the player in the centre of the screen.
When enabled `+forward` and `+back` will move the camera closer and further from
the player, and mouse movements will change the angle.

In either mode, if the demo UI is enabled (`cl_demoui 1`) then click and drag
with mouse2 to change the camera angle, or bind `+freeflymlook` (see below).  If
the demo UI is disabled (`cl_demoui 0`) then mouse movements will effect the
camera angle without need for extra key or button presses.

##### `democam_mode`

Set the camera mode for demo playback.  This is an alternative to using the
`freefly` and `orbit` toggles:

- `0`:  First person mode.
- `1`:  Freefly mode. See the `freefly` command for details.
- `2`:  Orbit mode. See the `orbit` command for details.
- `+1`: Cycle forward through modes.
- `-1`: Cycle backwards through modes.

##### `+freeflymlook` / `-freeflymlook`

When using freefly or orbit mode with the demo UI, this command makes mouse
movements adjust the camera angle.  Use this as an alternative to mouse2.
You'll typically want to bind this to a key, which should be held down to adjust
the camera angle.

##### `freefly_copycam`

Copy a ReMaic-style command to the clipboard, indicating the freefly camera's
location, viewing direction, and current demo timestamp.  The output must be
manipulated a little to make a valid ReMaic script --- the timestamp output as
the third copied line must be used as a prefix for the next command, and
likewise the copied `move` and `pan` command must be themselves prefixed with a
timestamp from the previous command.  This is because ReMaic's move and pan
commands indicate when the movement should *start* rather than when it should
end, so timestamps need to be shifted on by one.

In addition, the command takes an optional argument with one of the following
values, which changes the Remaic command that is copied:
- `move`:  Output `move` and `pan` commands as described above.
- `stay`:  Output a `stay` command at the camera's origin.
- `view`:  Output a `view` command for the point the camera is looking at.
- `endmove`:  Output an `end move` command.
- `endpan`:  Output an `end pan` command.
- `time`: Output the current time.

This command currently does not work on the win32 build.

##### `freefly_writecam [filename]`

Like `freefly_copycam`, but append commands to the provided filename instead.
This command is available on all builds.

##### `togglezoom`

Toggles between zoomed in and zoomed out views.
The FOV of the zoomed in view is controlled by the `zoom_fov` cvar.
The speed of the zoom animation is controlled by the `zoom_speed` cvar.

##### `+zoom`
##### `-zoom`

Same as togglezoom, but with 2 different commands (aliases) for zooming in and out separately.
