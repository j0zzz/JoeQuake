## Description

JoeQuake is a custom Quake engine designed exclusively for speedrunning.

* Independent server-client physics
* Ghost mode recording
* Browsable Demos/Maps/Mods menus
* Restructured, more detailed Options menu
* Mouse cursor in menu
* Supporting FitzQuake and RMQ protocols
* Supporting a wide range of custom mods (including Quake remastered)
* Colored static and dynamic lighting
* External texture formats (TGA/PNG/JPG)
* Capturing demos to AVI file
* SDA demo database, for directly downloading/watching speedrun records from speeddemosarchive.com/quake/
